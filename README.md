And the Adafruit Bluefruit App

Video demo at:


- Connect to the CPXb using the app
- Control Pad buttons 1-3 play a sound file
- Touching CPXb pad A1 will scream
In the video I attached the CPXb's A1 pad to an alligator clip, then attached the other end of the clip to a copper wire cut into the top of a $10 skull mask I picked up at a Halloween shop.
- I also added an Adafruit MonsterM4sk - software is included in the purchase, so no additional code required for the mask.

- I also connected the CPXb to the inexpensive Adafruit STEMMA speaker:

cap touch on A1 will scream "Don't take candy from strangers!". Bluefruit App control pad #1 - #4 + Up Arrow light up CPXb and play a sound summoning the potential candy-taker.
